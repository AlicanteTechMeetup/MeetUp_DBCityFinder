# AngularJS Tutorial: Create DBCityFinder

Follow up this tutorial and create a City Finder app using AngularJS and DBpedia!

You can find a full working and more complete app in [DBCityFinder repository](https://github.com/alexjoverm/DBCityFinder). This repo is for the MeetUp speech [AngularJS Introduction: create DBCityFinder app](http://www.meetup.com/AlicanteTech/events/225370473/)

## DBCityFinder, step by step

### 1. Scaffold your app... in Plunkr!

[Plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit) is a great webpage to do simple apps in a collaborative way, and share it with the people. So let's show how it's done:

1. Open [Plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit) and create an app from AngularJS1.4 template
2. We want Routing, so let's install **angular-route**
3. Create the main view `main_view.html`
4. Create the main controller `MainCtrl.js`
5. To avoid having a large controller, we can use a Factory `MainSvc.js`. They are a kind of Services, perfect to sort our code out!

### 2. Route the app
